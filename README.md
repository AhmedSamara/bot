# Bot

Code for the IEEE Robotics Team's 2014 robot(s).

## Style

### Python

1. Read [PEP8]
2. Re-read [PEP8]
3. Pedantically follow [PEP8]

### C

[PEP7] will be the standard, but pay special attention to exception #2, as I expect C code will be more likely to pull code blocks from other libs.

Exception 2: "Be consistent with surrounding code...although this is also an opportunity to clean up someone else's mess."

### Shell

If you really care, give [Google's Shell Style Guide][1] a read. Don't be too pedantic about shell scripts.
